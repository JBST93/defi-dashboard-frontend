      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Gearbox Protocol has revolutionized the DeFi landscape by introducing a
        sophisticated credit account system that enables users to access
        leverage across multiple DeFi protocols. Since its launch in 2021,
        Gearbox has become the go-to platform for leveraged DeFi strategies,
        allowing users to amplify their positions and maximize capital
        efficiency in ways that were previously impossible.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        By creating a unified credit system that works across various DeFi
        protocols, Gearbox has solved one of the biggest challenges in
        decentralized finance: accessing leverage without being limited to a
        single protocol. This innovation has opened up new possibilities for
        yield farmers, traders, and DeFi enthusiasts looking to optimize their
        capital allocation.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
        What is Gearbox Protocol?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Gearbox Protocol is a decentralized lending platform that provides
        leverage through a unique credit account system. Unlike traditional
        lending protocols that only allow borrowing within their own ecosystem,
        Gearbox creates credit accounts that can be used across multiple DeFi
        protocols, enabling sophisticated leveraged strategies.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The protocol operates on a two-sided model: lenders provide liquidity to
        earn interest, while borrowers can access this liquidity through credit
        accounts to implement leveraged strategies across various DeFi protocols
        like Uniswap, Curve, Convex, and many others.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
        How Gearbox Protocol Works
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Gearbox's core innovation lies in its credit account system. Here's how
        it works:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Credit Accounts
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        When you open a credit account with Gearbox, you deposit collateral and
        receive a credit limit based on your collateral's value and the
        protocol's risk parameters. This credit can then be used across multiple
        DeFi protocols to implement leveraged strategies.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Multi-Protocol Integration
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Credit accounts can interact with various DeFi protocols including:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <li>Uniswap V3 for leveraged liquidity provision</li>
        <li>Curve for leveraged stablecoin strategies</li>
        <li>Convex for boosted Curve rewards</li>
        <li>Yearn for leveraged vault strategies</li>
        <li>And many other integrated protocols</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Risk Management
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Gearbox employs sophisticated risk management mechanisms including
        health factor monitoring, liquidation thresholds, and dynamic interest
        rates to ensure the protocol remains solvent even during market
        volatility.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">

        Universal Credit System
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Unlike other lending protocols, Gearbox provides credit that can be used
        across multiple DeFi protocols, enabling complex cross-protocol
        strategies that weren't possible before.
      </p>

        10x depending on the collateral and strategy.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Automated Strategies
      </h3>
