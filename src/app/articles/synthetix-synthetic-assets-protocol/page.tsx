      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Synthetix has pioneered the synthetic assets space in DeFi, creating a
        protocol that enables users to trade synthetic versions of real-world
        assets without actually holding them. Since its launch in 2018,
        Synthetix has become one of the most innovative protocols in DeFi,
        enabling access to traditional assets like stocks, commodities, and
        currencies through blockchain technology.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        The protocol's unique debt pool model and synthetic asset system have
        created new possibilities for DeFi users, allowing them to gain exposure
        to traditional markets while maintaining the benefits of decentralized
        finance. Synthetix has grown to become one of the largest DeFi protocols
        by total value locked, demonstrating the demand for synthetic assets.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
        What is Synthetix?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Synthetix is a decentralized protocol that enables the creation and
        trading of synthetic assets (Synths) that track the price of real-world
        assets. Users can trade synthetic versions of stocks, commodities,
        currencies, and other assets without actually holding the underlying
        assets, all while maintaining the benefits of decentralized finance.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The protocol operates through a debt pool model where users stake SNX
        tokens as collateral to mint synthetic assets. This creates a system
        where all synthetic assets are backed by the collective collateral of
        SNX stakers, ensuring liquidity and stability for all synthetic assets.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
        How Synthetix Works
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Synthetix's core mechanism revolves around synthetic asset creation and
        trading:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Debt Pool Model
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Users stake SNX tokens as collateral to mint synthetic assets, creating
        a debt pool that backs all synthetic assets. This ensures that all
        synthetic assets are fully collateralized and liquid.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Synthetic Asset Creation
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Users can mint synthetic assets by staking SNX collateral, with the
        amount of synthetic assets they can mint determined by their
        collateralization ratio and the protocol's parameters.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Price Oracle System
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Synthetix uses a decentralized oracle system to provide accurate price
        feeds for all synthetic assets, ensuring that synthetic assets track
        their real-world counterparts accurately.
      </p>
