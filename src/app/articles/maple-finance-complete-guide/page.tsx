The stablecoin is backed by overcollateralised loans to institutional borrowers, meaning every loan has significant collateral (on average >150% of the loan value). This provides a strong buffer – even if a borrower defaults, their posted collateral can typically cover the debt. Moreover, borrowers are KYC-verified and legally bound, so Maple can pursue repayment through legal means in a worst-case scenario.",

Instead, your BTC is used in a staking mechanism on the Core blockchain (run by CoreDAO). When you deposit BTC, it's held by institutional custodians (like BitGo or Copper) and staked to help secure the Core network, which in turn pays out BTC rewards. There is no counterparty default risk because no one is borrowing your BTC – it's working in a protocol, somewhat like how staking ETH works.",

SyrupUSDC, on the other hand, represents a deposit of USDC into Maple's lending pool. The value of SyrupUSDC grows over time because it accrues interest from borrowers. One SyrupUSDC might be worth $1 today, but if you hold it for a year at ~10% APY, it could be redeemable for ~$1.10 of USDC.",

              Unlike open marketplaces such as Aave or Silo, Maple uses a
              curated approach: borrowers are vetted and often provide
              collateral, interest rates are set by credit experts (not just by
              market swings), and a revamped SYRUP token aligns with the
              platform&apos;s growth. This guide breaks down how Maple works,
              how retail users can earn yield, what sets Maple apart from Aave
              or Silo, and how Maple&apos;s SYRUP tokenomics function after
              migrating from the old MPL token. Short, clear sections and FAQs
              will help DeFi beginners understand Maple Finance step by step.

              Maple Finance&apos;s Institutional Lending Model
            </h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Maple Finance is essentially an on-chain fund manager for
              institutional loans. It connects lenders (liquidity providers)
              with institutional borrowers through secured, on-chain loan
              structures. Here&apos;s how it works in simple terms:
            </p>

            <div className="space-y-8 mb-8">
              <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">
                  Curated Borrowers
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Maple only lends to vetted institutional borrowers (like
                  trading firms, market makers, crypto businesses). All
                  borrowers undergo KYC and due diligence, ensuring they are
                  reputable firms with real-world accountability. Knowing the
                  borrower&apos;s identity provides legal recourse beyond posted
                  collateral if a loan defaults – a layer of protection you
                  won&apos;t get on fully anonymous platforms.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">
                  Overcollateralised Loans
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Borrowers on Maple often post collateral against their loans,
                  typically in crypto assets. In Maple&apos;s
                  &quot;Secured&quot; pools, loans are overcollateralised by
                  more than 150% on average. For example, the Blue Chip pool
                  only accepts BTC and ETH as collateral, whereas the High Yield
                  pool accepts riskier tokens (SOL, XRP, etc.) but at higher
                  collateral ratios. This reduces the chance lenders lose money
                  – if a borrower fails to repay, Maple can seize and liquidate
                  collateral.
                </p>

                  Unlike Aave or Silo where rates float with supply/demand,
                  Maple&apos;s interest rates are actively set by Maple&apos;s
                  team based on borrower risk. This means yields on Maple are
                  more stable over time. Borrowers benefit too – they lock in a
                  rate and won&apos;t see sudden spikes if the market gets
                  volatile.

                  diversification. By pooling liquidity, Maple makes it easier
                  for institutions to borrow large sums and for lenders to earn

                  Maple blends DeFi tech with traditional finance standards.
                  Every loan is documented and transparent on-chain, so lenders
                  can see who the borrower is, how much collateral they posted,
                  and the loan terms. Maple also employs institutional custody
                  solutions and risk analysis procedures akin to traditional
                  credit markets (e.g. using custodians for certain assets,
                  legal loan agreements). This compliance-first approach
                  provides confidence to large allocators that their capital is
                  handled prudently.

                In summary, Maple&apos;s model is more like an on-chain bank or
                credit fund: it actively underwrites loans to institutions,
                requires solid collateral and KYC, and offers a
                &quot;white-glove&quot; service (including 24/7 support and fast
                withdrawals). This stands in contrast to purely algorithmic
                lending platforms.

                The payoff for lenders is in the yields: Maple&apos;s
                institutional pools have delivered higher, steadier returns than
                generic DeFi markets. For example, in early 2024 Maple&apos;s
                Blue Chip pool averaged ~12.5% APY while Aave&apos;s USDC market
                was around 6%. Even Maple&apos;s more conservative pool yields
                have consistently outperformed Aave&apos;s rates about 80% of
                the time, thanks to Maple&apos;s fixed-rate approach.

              SyrupUSDC: A Yield-Bearing Stablecoin for Everyone
            </h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              One of Maple&apos;s most exciting offerings for DeFi users is
              SyrupUSDC, a yield-bearing stablecoin. SyrupUSDC (sometimes
              referred to as syrupUSD in Maple&apos;s docs) is essentially an
              interest-accruing version of USDC that anyone (outside the US) can
              mint and hold to earn yield. It provides &quot;institutional
              quality yield in a single liquid asset&quot; – as Maple&apos;s
              site puts it – but in a permissionless, open-access form.

                  How SyrupUSDC Works
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  To get SyrupUSDC, you deposit regular USDC into Maple&apos;s
                  SyrupUSDC pool via the Maple app or Syrup.fi interface. In
                  return, you receive SyrupUSDC tokens 1:1 for your deposit.
                  These tokens automatically accrue interest over time,
                  increasing in value relative to USDC. In practice,
                  SyrupUSDC&apos;s price slowly rises above $1 as yield
                  accumulates (rather than your token count increasing). You can
                  redeem SyrupUSDC back for USDC (plus earned interest) whenever
                  you want, or trade it on the open market.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6">

                  Yield Source
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Your SyrupUSDC is not just sitting idle – behind the scenes,
                  Maple deploys that USDC into overcollateralised institutional
                  loans (like those described above). Borrowers pay interest on
                  those loans, which flows to SyrupUSDC holders. Because
                  Maple&apos;s borrowers are generally creditworthy firms
                  posting significant collateral, the yields are both high and
                  sustainable. During Q1 2025, SyrupUSDC delivered an annualised
                  return around 10.6% (excluding any extra incentives),
                  outperforming other DeFi yield stablecoins like aUSDC (Aave)
                  or Compound&apos;s cUSDC which were in the ~5–6% range.

                  Instant Liquidity
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Unlike some lending platforms where withdrawals can take time
                  (or be subject to exit queues), SyrupUSDC offers near-instant
                  liquidity. Maple has seeded Uniswap and Balancer pools with
                  USDC–SyrupUSDC liquidity, so users can swap out anytime. This
                  was a major UX improvement introduced in 2024 – previously
                  lenders might wait days for loan cycles to repay, but now you
                  can exit immediately by trading SyrupUSDC for USDC on a DEX.
                  In short, you&apos;re never locked in; you get the high yield
                  without sacrificing liquidity.

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  As a true ERC-20 token, SyrupUSDC can be used across the DeFi
                  ecosystem. Maple has actively integrated SyrupUSDC with other
                  protocols to amplify its utility. For example, you can use
                  SyrupUSDC as collateral on lending markets like Morpho and
                  Euler, effectively looping your yield (borrow USDC against
                  SyrupUSDC and reinvest to multiply returns). Arbitrum&apos;s
                  &quot;DRIP&quot; incentive program even provides ARB token
                  rewards for those who borrow against SyrupUSDC, pushing
                  combined yields as high as 30–35% APY with leverage.

              <p className="text-blue-800 mb-4">
                Since launch in late 2024, SyrupUSDC has become one of the
                fastest-growing stablecoin yield products. By September 2025 its
                circulating supply surpassed $1 billion, placing it among the
                top three yield-bearing assets on Ethereum and Solana. This
                growth is driven by demand for reliable
                &quot;institutional-grade&quot; yield.
              </p>
              <p className="text-blue-800">
                SyrupUSDC expanded to the Arbitrum network in 2025 to reduce
                fees and broaden access, supported by Arbitrum&apos;s incentive
                programs. It&apos;s clear that SyrupUSDC has struck a chord with
                both DeFi users and large allocators seeking a sustainable
                high-yield stablecoin.

                <strong>Bottom line:</strong> SyrupUSDC offers everyday crypto
                users access to the kind of yields that were once only available
                in private credit markets. You can deposit USDC and seamlessly
                earn ~8–12% APY (variable over time) on a fully liquid, fully
                transparent stablecoin. All the heavy lifting – borrower
                sourcing, risk management, interest collection – is handled by
                Maple in the background. For non-U.S. retail users looking for a
                straightforward way to earn strong passive income on dollars,
                SyrupUSDC has become a go-to option.

                <strong>Note:</strong> U.S. persons are restricted from using
                SyrupUSDC due to regulatory compliance, but no special
                accreditation or KYC is required for others – just connect your
                wallet and deposit.

              In addition to stablecoin lending, Maple Finance has pioneered a
              unique offering for Bitcoin holders: Maple BTC Yield. This product
              lets you earn a yield on your BTC without lending it out to
              borrowers – a big draw for risk-averse BTC holders. Maple launched
              Bitcoin Yield in early 2025 to address the growing demand for
              &quot;safe&quot; BTC yield as more institutions sought to put idle
              Bitcoin to work.

                  Investors deposit Bitcoin into Maple&apos;s BTC Yield program
                  (deposits can often be made in the form of WBTC or via
                  custodial onboarding of BTC). In return, they start accruing
                  yield paid in BTC. The target yield has been around 5% net APY
                  in BTC – far above the near-0% you&apos;d earn just holding
                  Bitcoin in a wallet. By Q2 2025, Maple&apos;s BTC Yield pool
                  had ~$180M in BTC (1500+ BTC) earning ~5.2% APY, cementing it
                  as the premier on-chain BTC yield solution at the time.

                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Uniquely, BTC Yield involves no lending or leverage. Instead
                  of loaning your Bitcoin to a borrower, Maple stakes the BTC to
                  secure a blockchain network. Specifically, Maple partnered
                  with CoreDAO to stake BTC on the Core blockchain (a
                  Bitcoin-adjacent proof-of-stake network). Your BTC never
                  leaves the custody of trusted institutional custodians (like
                  BitGo, Copper, or Hex Trust) during this process. In simple
                  terms, the Bitcoin is locked in a secure staking contract to
                  help run the Core network, and the network pays out rewards
                  (in BTC) to Maple, which Maple passes to you. There are no
                  borrowers who might default and no complex DeFi strategies –
                  this is pure staking yield, so counterparty risk is minimal.

                  Maple designed BTC Yield for long-term Bitcoin holders (think
                  treasuries, funds, miners, and HODLers) who want extra return
                  without compromising on security. The BTC remains in cold
                  storage custody and is only used in ways that do not risk it
                  being lost or slashed (Core&apos;s staking is structured to
                  avoid slashing risks, and Maple&apos;s partners ensure proper
                  operation). Because of this focus, Maple&apos;s BTC Yield is
                  pitched as a &quot;simple, secure, and high-yield&quot;
                  solution for compliant institutions.

              <p className="text-green-800 mb-4">
                The BTC Yield program is offered under Maple&apos;s permissioned
                products, so KYC and a minimum investment (e.g. 100k USD worth)
                are required to participate (this ensures regulatory compliance
                since the product might be considered a security offering).
                Deposits are typically open-ended (no specific subscription
                window), and each program runs in 3-month cycles where the yield
                is delivered.
              </p>
              <p className="text-green-800">
                For example, an investor deposits BTC at the cycle start,
                accrues ~5% APY, and can choose to roll or withdraw after 3
                months. Maple also created structured variations like &quot;Lend
                & Long&quot;, which combine lending yields with Bitcoin call
                options for upside, but those are more niche.

                To sum up, Maple&apos;s BTC Yield gives Bitcoin a savings
                account of sorts – one backed by blockchain staking rather than
                loans. It has quickly grown in popularity; in its first quarter,
                over 950 BTC were deposited. While it&apos;s currently aimed at
                accredited investors, it showcases Maple&apos;s innovation in
                bringing new asset classes (like BTC) into the on-chain yield
                space. For retail crypto users, it&apos;s a promising sign that
                in the future even your Bitcoin might earn interest as easily as
                your stablecoins, through platforms like Maple.

              Maple&apos;s ecosystem might sound institutional, but DeFi-curious
              retail users can absolutely get involved (as long as you&apos;re
              in an eligible jurisdiction). Here are the main ways to

                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  This is the most straightforward option for regular users.
                  Simply convert your USDC into SyrupUSDC on Maple&apos;s
                  platform to start earning yield. Below is a step-by-step
                  guide:

                    <li>
                      <strong>Step 1:</strong> Acquire USDC (the USD-pegged
                      stablecoin) via an exchange or fiat on-ramp if you
                      don&apos;t already have some.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to Maple&apos;s Syrup
                      interface for open-access lending – you can visit the
                      Maple Finance app or syrup.fi directly. Connect your Web3
                      wallet (MetaMask or similar).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Step 3:</strong> Ensure you meet basic
                      requirements (you will typically need to confirm you are
                      not a U.S. person due to Maple&apos;s compliance checks).
                      No formal KYC process or documents are required for
                      SyrupUSDC – it&apos;s open to any non-restricted user.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Step 4:</strong> In the app, select SyrupUSDC and
                      enter the amount of USDC you want to deposit. Confirm the
                      transaction to deposit USDC into Maple&apos;s pool.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Step 5:</strong> Receive SyrupUSDC tokens in your
                      wallet. Now you&apos;re earning yield! The value of each
                      SyrupUSDC token will gradually increase as interest
                      accrues from Maple&apos;s lending activities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Step 6:</strong> Monitor your yield. The Maple app
                      will show the current APY for SyrupUSDC (which fluctuates
                      slightly based on loan activity). Historically it&apos;s
                      been in the high single digits to low double digits.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Step 7:</strong> Redeem or utilize as needed. You
                      can convert back to USDC by redeeming via the Maple app
                      (subject to available liquidity in the pool), or instantly
                      swap SyrupUSDC for USDC on a DEX like Uniswap.

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  This process gives retail users a convenient way to earn from
                  Maple&apos;s institutional lending indirectly, through the
                  SyrupUSDC token. It&apos;s similar to how one might use
                  Aave&apos;s aUSDC – but with Maple&apos;s added benefits of
                  higher yields and professional credit underwriting.

                  2. Stake SYRUP tokens (governance staking)
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  If you want to participate in Maple&apos;s success more
                  directly (and don&apos;t necessarily have large amounts of
                  USDC to lend), you can consider buying Maple&apos;s native
                  token SYRUP on an exchange and staking it. Staking SYRUP
                  (converting it to stSYRUP) allows you to earn a share of the
                  protocol&apos;s revenue and participate in governance.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Maple uses 20% of all loan interest and fee revenue to buy
                  back SYRUP tokens from the market. These bought-back tokens
                  (plus any scheduled emissions) are distributed to stSYRUP
                  stakers as rewards. In essence, if Maple&apos;s lending
                  business does well, stakers receive more tokens – aligning the
                  token&apos;s value with platform performance.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  By staking, you also secure the right to vote on Maple
                  governance proposals (such as protocol upgrades or parameter
                  changes). Maple Improvement Proposals (MIPs) are decided by
                  SYRUP holders, so being staked gives you a voice in the
                  platform&apos;s future.

                  3. Permissioned Products (for qualified participants)
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Lastly, if you happen to be an accredited or institutional
                  investor (some experienced retail users might qualify),
                  Maple&apos;s Blue Chip, High Yield, and BTC Yield pools are
                  accessible through a permissioned interface. You would need to
                  go through Maple&apos;s KYC verification and meet minimum
                  investment sizes (often ≥ $100,000) to lend in those pools.
                  The upside is accessing Maple&apos;s highest yields – e.g.
                  ~15–20% APY in the High Yield USDC pool or participating in
                  structured products. Maple provides a &quot;white glove&quot;
                  service for these clients, including dedicated support. For
                  most casual users, this route isn&apos;t practical, but
                  it&apos;s good to know Maple caters to both ends: truly open
                  DeFi via SyrupUSDC, and regulated larger-scale lending via
                  Maple Institutional.

                <strong>Tip:</strong> No matter which way you participate,
                always do some homework. Review Maple&apos;s documentation and
                risk disclosures (e.g. Maple openly states that using the
                protocol carries risks of loss). Diversify your investments and
                don&apos;t chase high yield with more than you can afford to
                lose. Maple Finance has proven robust so far, but as with any
                DeFi platform, smart contract exploits or unforeseen borrower
                crises can occur.

                      borrowers in court if they default (in addition to

                      contagion risk that exists in Aave&apos;s pooled model.
                      However, low-liquidity assets in silos may be hard to
                      liquidate, and smart contract risk remains.

                Key Takeaways

              <p className="text-green-800 mb-4">
                As shown above, Maple sets itself apart by blending the
                reliability of traditional finance with the openness of DeFi. It
                sacrifices a bit of decentralisation (with KYC for institutions
                and manually set rates) in order to unlock undercollateralised
                lending and higher yields that protocols like Aave can&apos;t
                offer.
              </p>
              <p className="text-green-800 mb-4">
                In return, Maple offers yield opportunities (and asset types)
                that are hard to find elsewhere – for example, earning ~5% on
                Bitcoin or 10% on stablecoins without the wild swings of
                algorithmic rates. Silo, meanwhile, is tackling a different
                problem (isolating altcoin risk in lending) and Aave remains the
                general-purpose money market with massive scale.
              </p>
              <p className="text-green-800">
                For users, it&apos;s not necessarily an either/or choice: Maple
                can be a complement to platforms like Aave. You might use Aave
                for borrowing against your assets or for lower-risk, lower-yield
                lending, while using Maple (via SyrupUSDC or other products) for
                a portion of your portfolio where you want extra yield from
                institutional lending.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              No discussion of Maple Finance is complete without covering its
              native token and recent tokenomics changes. Maple originally
              launched with the MPL token, but in late 2024 it underwent a major
              token revamp. The MPL token was migrated to a new token called
              $SYRUP as part of Maple&apos;s growth initiative. This
              MPL-to-SYRUP migration was completed by April 30, 2025, after
              which MPL ceased to be used.

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Each 1 MPL was converted into 100 SYRUP. This 100:1 split did
                  not dilute holders; it was purely a unit change to make the
                  token more granular and &quot;approachable&quot; in price. As
                  part of the migration, Maple&apos;s protocol minted a total of
                  approximately 1.15 billion SYRUP tokens. This included 1
                  billion SYRUP as the base supply (corresponding to the
                  previous MPL supply times 100) plus tokens to account for
                  Maple&apos;s planned inflation schedule and treasury needs.

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  In fact, an initial 10% inflation (100 million SYRUP) and some
                  additional tokens for the Maple Treasury (per a prior proposal
                  MIP-009) were all minted up front into the supply.

                  Value Accrual Mechanism
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  SYRUP is designed as a value-accrual and governance token for
                  the Maple ecosystem. The key to its tokenomics is the staking
                  model. Holders can stake SYRUP into stSYRUP to earn a share of
                  Maple&apos;s revenue. Maple allocates 20% of all protocol
                  revenues (interest fees, etc.) to buying back SYRUP on the
                  open market. The purchased SYRUP, along with scheduled token
                  emissions, is distributed to stakers as rewards.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  This creates a feedback loop: as Maple&apos;s lending business
                  grows (and generates more fees), more value is funneled to
                  SYRUP via buybacks, ideally boosting its price or at least
                  rewarding token holders. In Q2 2025, Maple reaffirmed this 20%
                  revenue-to-buybacks policy as a pillar of SYRUP&apos;s value
                  proposition.
                </p>

                  Staking Rewards and Utility
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  In practice, when you stake SYRUP, you receive stSYRUP and
                  immediately start earning yield paid in SYRUP. Upon launch of
                  SYRUP in late 2024, Maple even allocated a special staking
                  reward program for the first 90 days to encourage adoption.
                  Beyond yield, staking also is likely tied to governance –
                  Maple&apos;s governance proposals (MIPs) are now voted on by
                  SYRUP holders, potentially with stSYRUP needed to vote (to
                  encourage long-term alignment).
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  By staking, you&apos;re signaling a long-term belief in Maple
                  and in return you gain both influence and a cut of the
                  revenue.

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  SYRUP is Maple&apos;s governance token, inheriting MPL&apos;s
                  former role. Decisions like parameter changes, new pool
                  launches, or treasury actions are governed by SYRUP holders
                  through on-chain voting. The migration to SYRUP aimed to widen
                  distribution, and indeed the token holder count grew
                  significantly in early 2025.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Having SYRUP listed on major exchanges (Coinbase in March
                  2025, and later Binance, etc.) improved liquidity and
                  distribution, which is healthy for decentralized governance.
                  Post-migration, SYRUP (and stSYRUP) are the sole tokens in
                  Maple&apos;s ecosystem for governance and value capture –
                  legacy MPL or xMPL are no longer usable.

                  • If Maple&apos;s lending business thrives (more loans, more
                  interest), SYRUP holders and stakers directly benefit via
                  buybacks and yields.
                </li>
                <li>
                  • The token conversion and higher supply improved liquidity
                  (no more tiny float issues) and allowed broader exchange
                  listings, making SYRUP more accessible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  • SYRUP continues to serve as the governance backbone of
                  Maple, upholding decentralization even as the protocol works
                  closely with institutions.

              </ul>
              <p className="text-blue-800 mt-4">
                For token holders, the post-migration landscape looks promising:
                Maple&apos;s revenues have been growing (154% growth in Q2 2025
                year-on-year), and the protocol&apos;s AUM hit new highs, which
                could feed into stronger buybacks and staking APR. However,
                SYRUP&apos;s market price will still ebb and flow with crypto
                markets and perceived execution of Maple&apos;s vision.
                It&apos;s a long-term play on the success of institutional DeFi.

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  A: SyrupUSDC is designed with safety in mind, but like any
                  DeFi product it isn&apos;t 100% risk-free. The stablecoin is
                  backed by overcollateralised loans to institutional borrowers,
                  meaning every loan has significant collateral (on average
                  &gt;150% of the loan value). This provides a strong buffer –
                  even if a borrower defaults, their posted collateral can
                  typically cover the debt. Moreover, borrowers are KYC-verified
                  and legally bound, so Maple can pursue repayment through legal
                  means in a worst-case scenario. These measures make SyrupUSDC
                  much safer than uncollateralised lending platforms. Maple also
                  conducts rigorous risk analysis and has a track record of
                  proactively off-boarding risky borrowers. In addition,
                  SyrupUSDC smart contracts have been audited, and Maple seeded
                  liquidity to ensure you can exit positions quickly (reducing
                  the risk of being &quot;stuck&quot; during market stress).
                  However, risks still exist – for example, extreme market
                  crashes could impair collateral value faster than Maple can
                  liquidate, or a smart contract vulnerability could be
                  exploited. There&apos;s also USDC&apos;s own risk (SyrupUSDC
                  is only as stable as USDC itself; if USDC were to depeg or
                  face issues, SyrupUSDC would be impacted). Maple&apos;s
                  documentation is transparent that using the protocol involves
                  the &quot;potential loss of digital assets&quot; if things go
                  wrong. So, SyrupUSDC is relatively safe by DeFi standards and
                  has performed without incident to date, but never invest funds
                  you can&apos;t afford to lose.

                  Q: How does Maple&apos;s BTC Yield work?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  A: Maple&apos;s BTC Yield product lets you earn roughly 5% APY
                  on Bitcoin without lending it out to any borrower. Instead,
                  your BTC is used in a staking mechanism on the Core blockchain
                  (run by CoreDAO). When you deposit BTC, it&apos;s held by
                  institutional custodians (like BitGo or Copper) and staked to
                  help secure the Core network, which in turn pays out BTC
                  rewards. Maple collects those rewards and passes the yield to
                  you. There is no counterparty default risk because no one is
                  borrowing your BTC – it&apos;s working in a protocol, somewhat
                  like how staking ETH works. Also, no leverage is used, so the
                  yield is purely from network rewards. Maple&apos;s role is to
                  facilitate this for you in a compliant way: they partnered
                  with CoreDAO, handle the technical integration, and ensure
                  custody is safe. The product is targeted at institutions and
                  accredited investors, so you do have to go through KYC and
                  meet a minimum deposit. But operationally, it&apos;s simple:
                  you deposit BTC, and Maple pays out yield in BTC (usually
                  accruing daily or weekly). The main risks here are different
                  from lending – you&apos;d worry about the security of the
                  staking infrastructure or the custodian. Maple mitigates these
                  by using reputable custodians and by the fact that &quot;BTC
                  never leaves custody&quot; during the process (it&apos;s not
                  floating around in DeFi contracts). In short, BTC Yield is
                  like putting your Bitcoin in a very secure savings account
                  that pays ~5% in kind. It&apos;s been very popular – Maple
                  reported 950+ BTC deposited in Q1 2025 shortly after launch –
                  showing that many Bitcoin holders found this approach
                  attractive.

                  Q: Can I lose money using Maple?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  A: Yes, you can – no yield is free of risk. While Maple works
                  hard to minimise risks, lenders must understand the scenarios
                  where losses could occur: Borrower Default: In Maple&apos;s
                  lending pools (including the ones backing SyrupUSDC), if a
                  borrower defaults and their collateral doesn&apos;t cover the
                  full loan, lenders could take a loss. Maple&apos;s high
                  collateral requirements make this unlikely for secured pools,
                  but not impossible (e.g. a sudden 70% market crash could
                  undermine a 150% collateralised loan if liquidations lag).
                  That said, Maple&apos;s additional safeguards (KYC, legal
                  contracts) give more avenues to recover funds than pure DeFi
                  platforms. Smart Contract Hacks: Maple is a protocol of smart
                  contracts – a bug or exploit in the contracts for SyrupUSDC or
                  Maple&apos;s pools could potentially lead to loss of funds.
                  Maple has been audited and has not had major incidents, but
                  DeFi history shows even well-audited projects can be hacked.
                  Users should be aware of this technical risk. Stablecoin or
                  Custody Risk: If you&apos;re using SyrupUSDC, remember
                  it&apos;s effectively USDC under the hood. If USDC were to
                  collapse or blacklisting issues occur, SyrupUSDC would be
                  affected. Similarly, for BTC Yield, if a custodian were
                  compromised or the Core network had an issue, that could
                  impact funds. Extreme Market Conditions: In a severe crypto
                  meltdown or systemic crisis, Maple might face multiple loan
                  defaults or frozen liquidity. Even though SyrupUSDC has
                  instant liquidity in normal times, during a crisis the DEX
                  price of SyrupUSDC could drop below $1 (if everyone rushes to
                  exit and underlying loans need time to wind down). Maple could
                  even pause withdrawals if needed to prevent a run (this is not
                  known to have happened, but is a theoretical possibility in
                  any lending fund). Protocol Insolvency: If losses in a Maple
                  pool exceeded the collateral and any first-loss capital, that
                  pool could become insolvent (owing lenders more than it can
                  repay). This is a tail-risk scenario, but lenders should know
                  it&apos;s not a zero-risk game. The good news is that Maple
                  has a strong record so far in its current incarnation – the
                  protocol navigated the 2022–2023 bear market (where some
                  earlier loans defaulted) and implemented improvements to
                  prevent recurrence (like requiring collateral). In 2024–2025,
                  Maple&apos;s loans have performed without losses, and
                  withdrawals have typically been processed quickly (often under
                  24 hours). Nonetheless, as Maple&apos;s own disclaimer states,
                  using the protocol is at your own risk, and no one guarantees
                  your principal. The yields reflect the fact that lenders are
                  taking on some risk. Bottom line: you can lose money on Maple,
                  but the platform is structured to substantially mitigate risk,
                  and it offers much more transparency and protection
                  (collaterals, legal agreements) than many other high-yield
                  opportunities.

                  Q: How is SyrupUSDC different from USDC?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  A: SyrupUSDC is like an earning version of USDC. Think of USDC
                  as a static $1 coin – it stays $1 and doesn&apos;t yield
                  anything on its own. SyrupUSDC, on the other hand, represents
                  a deposit of USDC into Maple&apos;s lending pool. The value of
                  SyrupUSDC grows over time because it accrues interest from
                  borrowers. One SyrupUSDC might be worth $1 today, but if you
                  hold it for a year at ~10% APY, it could be redeemable for
                  ~$1.10 of USDC. This is similar to how something like
                  Aave&apos;s aUSDC or Compound&apos;s cUSDC works (the token
                  exchange rate increases). However, Maple brands it as a
                  stablecoin for ease of use. SyrupUSDC is pegged to USDC&apos;s
                  value in the sense that it&apos;s fully backed and redeemable,
                  but its price will drift upward as yield accumulates.
                  You&apos;ll typically interact with it just as you would USDC
                  – you can send it, store it, or swap it – but the smart
                  contract is doing the work to earn yield in the background.
                  When you want to cash out, you convert SyrupUSDC back to
                  regular USDC (either via Maple or via an exchange). The small
                  growth in price is how you collect your interest. In summary:
                  USDC = just a dollar, SyrupUSDC = a dollar that&apos;s earning
                  interest while you hold it. Always keep an eye on
                  SyrupUSDC&apos;s current redemption rate (it should be
                  displayed in the app or via on-chain data) so you know its
                  true value relative to USDC at any given time.

                  Q: Do I need Maple&apos;s SYRUP tokens to use the platform?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  A: No. Maple&apos;s lending products (SyrupUSDC, BTC Yield,
                  etc.) do not require you to hold any SYRUP tokens. You can
                  deposit and withdraw liquidity freely in Maple&apos;s pools
                  without ever touching the governance token. SYRUP is mainly
                  for those interested in governance and earning a share of
                  Maple&apos;s fees (via staking). This is unlike some protocols
                  that might require you to hold their token for higher yields
                  or as collateral; Maple keeps usage separate from the token.
                  Of course, if you believe in Maple long-term, you might choose
                  to acquire SYRUP to have a stake in the ecosystem&apos;s
                  growth, but it&apos;s entirely optional. Borrowers on Maple
                  similarly don&apos;t need to use the SYRUP token – they repay
                  loans in USDC or BTC as per their agreements. So, SYRUP is not
                  a utility token in the sense of accessing loans or yields;
                  it&apos;s more of a governance and profit-sharing token in
                  Maple&apos;s design.
