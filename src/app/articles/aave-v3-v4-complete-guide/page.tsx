                  <strong>Aave V3</strong> is one of the largest decentralised
                  lending protocols in DeFi, bridging those with excess crypto
                  capital and those who need liquidity. By mid-2025, Aave
                  dominates the sector – holding nearly 48% of all DeFi lending
                  liquidity (over $25 billion TVL) – thanks to its user-friendly
                  design and robust risk management.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>What it does:</strong> Users can lend their crypto to
                  earn interest, or borrow crypto by providing collateral.
                  Unlike traditional peer-to-peer lending, Aave uses a
                  peer-to-pool model where lenders deposit assets into a pool
                  and borrowers draw from that pooled liquidity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Key features:</strong> E-Mode (higher LTV for
                  correlated assets), Isolation Mode (safer listings),
                  supply/borrow caps, gas optimisations, and cross-chain
                  portals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Popular strategies:</strong> Stablecoin lending for
                  passive yield, E-Mode loops for leveraged positions, and carry
                  trades when borrow rates are lower than external yields.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Safety first:</strong> Always maintain a health factor
                  above 1.0, use moderate leverage, and stick to major assets if
                  you&apos;re new to DeFi.

              What is Aave and How Does It Work?
            </h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Aave is a decentralised, non-custodial liquidity protocol where
              users can lend their crypto to earn interest, or borrow crypto by
              providing collateral. Unlike traditional peer-to-peer lending,
              Aave uses a peer-to-pool model: lenders deposit assets into a pool
              and borrowers draw from that pooled liquidity. Each deposit earns
              interest and in return lenders receive aTokens (e.g. depositing
              ETH yields aETH) that automatically accrue interest. Borrowers
              must over-collateralise – meaning you must supply assets worth
              more than the value you borrow – ensuring the loan is secured by
              collateral. Interest rates on Aave adjust algorithmically based on
              supply and demand for each asset (higher utilisation raises rates,
              incentivising more supply).
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              When you borrow on Aave, the protocol assigns you a health factor
              that indicates the safety buffer of your position. A health factor
              above 1.0 means your collateral sufficiently covers your loan; if
              it falls below 1, your position can be liquidated. In a
              liquidation, a portion of your collateral is sold (or seized by
              liquidators) to repay the debt, plus a liquidation fee (penalty).
              For safety, Aave sets a liquidation threshold for each asset – for
              example, if an asset has an 80% threshold, borrowing more than 80%
              of its value will trigger liquidation. Maintaining a healthy
              buffer (e.g. keeping health factor well above 1) is crucial to
              avoid being liquidated.
            </p>

              <p className="text-green-800">
                <strong>Key points:</strong> As an Aave user, you can withdraw
                your deposits anytime (if liquidity is available) and repay
                loans anytime. The protocol is governed by AAVE token holders
                who set parameters. No central authority controls funds –
                Aave&apos;s smart contracts do, making it a trustless DeFi
                platform (albeit with inherent smart contract risks as discussed
                later).

              Aave V3 Features and Improvements
            </h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Aave&apos;s third version (V3) launched in 2022 introduced several
              improvements to enhance capital efficiency and risk management.
              Here are the key features of Aave V3 that benefit users:
            </p>

            <div className="space-y-8 mb-8">
              <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">
                  High Efficiency Mode (E-Mode)
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Aave V3 allows borrowers to maximise their borrowing power
                  when using highly correlated assets as collateral. Users can
                  opt into an E-Mode category (e.g. USD stablecoins or liquid
                  staking derivatives) which boosts the Loan-to-Value (LTV)
                  ratio for that category. For instance, in the stablecoin
                  E-Mode category, you can borrow up to ~97% of your
                  collateral&apos;s value in another stablecoin (versus ~75% LTV
                  normally). By restricting borrowing to assets in the same
                  category, the protocol grants a higher LTV and lower
                  liquidation threshold since the assets move in tandem.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm">
                  <strong>Bottom line:</strong> E-Mode lets you borrow more
                  against your collateral within the same asset class, greatly
                  increasing capital efficiency.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6">

                  Isolation Mode
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Aave V3 introduced Isolation Mode to safely list newer or
                  riskier assets as collateral. When an asset is designated
                  &quot;isolated,&quot; it means if you use it as collateral,
                  you can only borrow certain stablecoins (approved by
                  governance) and only up to a debt limit. No other assets can
                  be used as collateral alongside it. This containment limits
                  potential damage from volatile or unproven assets.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm">
                  <strong>Example:</strong> If you supply a new token in
                  Isolation Mode, you might only be able to borrow USDC/DAI up
                  to, say, $5M total – protecting the rest of the platform from
                  that asset&apos;s risk.

                  Supply and Borrow Caps
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  V3 allows the community to set caps on how much of each asset
                  can be deposited or borrowed. These caps prevent any single
                  asset from growing too large in the pool (which could increase
                  risk or affect protocol solvency). Caps are especially useful
                  for mitigating risks like infinite mint glitches or oracle
                  manipulation attacks on a given token.

                  Gas Optimisations
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  V3 made technical improvements to reduce gas costs for using
                  Aave on Ethereum and other chains. Actions like deposits,
                  borrows, and liquidations are more gas-efficient than in V2,
                  saving users fees. These optimisations make Aave more usable
                  on Layer-1 and also facilitate cheaper use on Layer-2
                  networks.

                  Cross-Chain Portal
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Aave V3 introduced a feature called Portal that enables
                  cross-chain liquidity movement. Users can deposit in one
                  network and then essentially teleport their liquidity to
                  another chain&apos;s Aave market (by burning aTokens on source
                  and minting on destination). This is facilitated via approved
                  bridge protocols.

                <strong>In summary:</strong> Aave V3&apos;s features focus on
                capital efficiency (E-Mode, cross-chain) and risk mitigation
                (Isolation Mode, caps), allowing Aave to support more assets and
                use-cases without compromising stability.

              If you&apos;re new to Aave, here&apos;s a step-by-step guide on
              how to lend and borrow using Aave V3:

                  1. Connect a Wallet
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Visit the Aave app and connect a Web3 wallet (e.g. MetaMask).
                  Ensure you&apos;re on a supported network (Ethereum by
                  default, or switch to Polygon, etc. as needed).
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">
                  2. Deposit an Asset (Supply)
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Choose a cryptocurrency you want to lend (for example, USDC
                  stablecoin or ETH). Click &quot;Supply&quot; and enter the
                  amount. Submitting this transaction will deposit your asset
                  into Aave&apos;s pool. In return, you&apos;ll receive aTokens
                  in your wallet (e.g. aUSDC) representing your deposit – these
                  automatically earn interest. You can supply multiple assets if
                  you want to diversify your lending.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">
                  3. Enable Collateral (Optional)
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  If you plan to borrow against an asset you supplied, you must
                  enable it as collateral. In the Aave dashboard, there&apos;s a
                  toggle for each supplied asset to mark it as collateral.
                  Toggle on the asset(s) you want to use to borrow. (Some
                  assets, like isolated ones, may be automatically set as
                  collateral or have restrictions.)
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">
                  4. Check Your Borrow Limits
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Aave will show your borrowing power based on the collateral
                  you enabled. It also shows a health factor, which starts at
                  &quot;∞&quot; if you have no loans. This will drop as you
                  borrow – keep it comfortably above 1 to avoid liquidation.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">
                  5. Borrow an Asset
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Now navigate to the &quot;Borrow&quot; section. Here
                  you&apos;ll see assets available to borrow and the interest
                  rates (variable and/or stable rate). Select the asset you want
                  to borrow (e.g. perhaps you deposit ETH and want to borrow a
                  stablecoin like DAI). Enter an amount within your allowed
                  limit – Aave will show the max you can borrow based on your
                  collateral and the asset&apos;s LTV. It&apos;s wise to borrow
                  much less than the max (e.g. &lt;50% of your limit) to
                  maintain a safe buffer. Submit the transaction to borrow.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">
                  6. Use Your Loan (and Earn on Deposits)
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Once borrowed, you can use those funds for anything – trading,
                  yield farming, or simply hold them. Meanwhile, your deposited
                  collateral continues earning interest. If you borrowed a
                  different asset than you deposited, you effectively have
                  liquidity without selling your original holdings (e.g. keep
                  exposure to ETH while borrowing stablecoins to spend).
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">
                  7. Monitoring and Managing
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Regularly check your health factor and the values of your
                  assets. If your collateral value drops or your borrowed
                  asset&apos;s price rises (relative to collateral), your health
                  factor falls. You can adjust by repaying part of the loan or
                  adding more collateral to raise the health factor. Aave&apos;s
                  interface gives a colour-coded health meter; treat anything
                  close to 1.0 as high risk.

              </div>

              <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">
                  8. Repay and Withdraw
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  When you&apos;re ready to close your position, go to
                  &quot;Repay&quot;. Select the asset you borrowed, and repay
                  the amount (note: you can&apos;t withdraw collateral until
                  corresponding debt is repaid). After repaying (including all
                  accrued interest), your borrowing power frees up. You can then
                  go to your supplied assets and &quot;Withdraw&quot; whatever
                  you supplied (plus interest earned).

              <p className="text-yellow-800">
                <strong>Tip:</strong> You can repay loans with the same asset
                you borrowed (if you have it), or use Aave&apos;s collateral
                swap/repay features to repay using collateral directly. Also
                note that Aave charges interest in real-time; if you repay
                early, you only pay interest for the days borrowed.

              Practical Strategies on Aave V3
            </h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Aave isn&apos;t just for straightforward lending/borrowing – DeFi
              users have developed strategies to maximise yields or manage risks
              using Aave&apos;s features. Here are two practical strategies
              suitable for retail users:
            </p>

            <div className="space-y-8 mb-8">
              <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6">
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">
                  1. Stablecoin Lending for Passive Yield
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  One of the most popular low-risk strategies is lending
                  stablecoins on Aave to earn interest. Stablecoins (like USDC,
                  DAI, USDT) are pegged to fiat currencies (e.g. $1), so their
                  value is stable – making them ideal for earning yield without
                  exposure to crypto price volatility. By depositing stablecoins
                  into Aave, you can earn an APY that often beats traditional
                  bank savings rates or money market funds.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  For example, Aave&apos;s USD stablecoin market is often seen
                  as the &quot;base rate&quot; in DeFi, with rates fluctuating
                  based on demand. In mid-2025, Aave&apos;s USDC deposit rate
                  ranged roughly from 5-10% APR (variable) depending on market
                  conditions. This interest comes from other users borrowing
                  those stablecoins (perhaps traders or yield farmers), who pay
                  interest to lenders.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm">
                  <strong>To execute this strategy:</strong> Simply supply
                  stablecoins (USDC, DAI, etc.) to Aave and let them sit and
                  accrue interest. It&apos;s a set-and-forget approach – ideal
                  for a DeFi &quot;savings account&quot; on idle cash. You can
                  withdraw anytime if you need the funds.

                  2. E-Mode Loop (Leverage) Strategy
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  For more advanced users, Aave&apos;s Efficiency Mode (E-Mode)
                  opens the door to leveraged yield strategies, sometimes called
                  looping. The idea is to deposit an asset and borrow more of
                  the same (or similar) asset, repeatedly, to amplify your
                  exposure or yield. Thanks to E-Mode&apos;s high LTV, you can
                  loop many times.

                      In stablecoin E-Mode, all assets in the category are
                      pegged to $1. For example, you can deposit USDC, enable
                      E-Mode for stablecoins, and then borrow another stablecoin
                      like DAI or USDT up to ~97% LTV. You can then swap the
                      borrowed stablecoin back to USDC (or another stablecoin)
                      and deposit it again into Aave, increasing your deposit

                      (which represent staked ETH) are highly correlated with
                      ETH itself. In E-Mode, you might deposit stETH and borrow
                      ETH (or vice versa) at a high LTV (often 90%+). You can
                      then buy more stETH with the borrowed ETH and deposit it,
                      repeating the process.

                <strong>Important:</strong> In both looping strategies, you are
                using Aave as a leveraged yield platform. They illustrate the
                power of E-Mode: by treating correlated assets more favorably,
                Aave lets you do things that would be far riskier otherwise.
                Remember to account for Aave&apos;s interest rate swings –
                borrowing costs can rise if utilization increases, so a loop
                that was profitable can turn unprofitable. Always have an exit
                plan: you may need to unwind loops quickly in volatile
                conditions to avoid liquidation.

              Aave is a powerful tool, but using it (especially with leverage)
              comes with risks that every user should understand:

                <p className="text-red-800">
                  If the value of your collateral falls or the value of your
                  debt rises to the point that your health factor drops below 1,
                  you can be liquidated. Aave&apos;s smart contracts will allow
                  liquidators to repay your debt and claim your collateral (plus
                  a fee). For example, if you borrow 75% against your ETH and
                  then ETH&apos;s price drops 30%, your collateral is no longer
                  enough and liquidation can occur. Liquidation typically incurs
                  a penalty (e.g. an extra 5-10% of the debt value) that you
                  effectively lose.

                </h3>
                <p className="text-red-800">
                  A common mistake is to get too aggressive with borrowing or
                  looping strategies, leaving no room for error. Over-leverage
                  means even small market moves can wipe you out. It&apos;s
                  essentially self-imposed risk. Aave&apos;s interface might
                  allow you to borrow a high amount (especially in E-Mode), but
                  discipline is key – just because 97% LTV is allowed
                  doesn&apos;t mean you should use it. Many experienced users
                  stick to, say, 50-75% of their maximum borrowing capacity to
                  stay safe.

                <p className="text-red-800">
                  While Aave has been audited and has an excellent security
                  track record (no major exploits to date), it is ultimately a
                  collection of smart contracts. There is always a non-zero risk
                  of bugs, hacks, or vulnerabilities in Aave or its integrated
                  components (like oracles, bridges, etc.). Additionally,
                  admin/governance risks exist – Aave is controlled by token
                  governance, and although decentralised, changes or upgrades
                  could in theory introduce issues.

                <p className="text-red-800">
                  When dealing with &quot;stable&quot; assets or highly
                  correlated assets, one might underestimate risk. As noted
                  earlier, a stablecoin depeg can wreak havoc on E-Mode
                  positions. Even outside E-Mode, if you borrowed DAI against
                  ETH and DAI spiked off its peg, you could face unexpected
                  liquidations. Aave relies on external price oracles – if an
                  oracle fails or is manipulated, it could incorrectly calculate
                  collateral values.

                <p className="text-red-800">
                  Aave offers both variable and stable interest rates for
                  borrowing. Variable rates can change rapidly as utilization
                  changes. In fast-moving markets, borrow APRs for popular
                  assets can spike (we saw &gt;15% APY on USDC during market
                  swings in early 2025). If you&apos;re borrowing at a variable
                  rate, you must be prepared for the cost to increase. A
                  prolonged period of high rates could make a leveraged position
                  unprofitable or force you to unwind.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Aave is often considered the blue-chip of DeFi lending, but
              it&apos;s not the only approach out there. Let&apos;s briefly
              compare Aave V3 to a couple of other lending protocols with
              different designs: Silo Finance and Maple Finance.

                  Silo Finance (Isolated Lending Pools)
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Silo takes an almost opposite approach to Aave&apos;s shared
                  pool. Instead of pooling all assets together, Silo creates
                  separate lending markets for each asset, isolating risk so
                  that an issue with one token doesn&apos;t affect the others.
                  In Silo, every asset is paired with a common bridge asset
                  (like ETH or a stablecoin) in its own &quot;silo.&quot;
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  For example, there might be a separate pool for TokenX
                  &lt;-&gt; ETH, another for TokenY &lt;-&gt; ETH, and so on. If
                  TokenX experiences a hack or a price collapse, only the TokenX
                  silo (and its ETH bridge) are impacted – not the whole
                  protocol. This design prevents cross-contamination of risk and
                  allows Silo to list long-tail (more experimental) assets that
                  Aave might not touch.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm">
                  <strong>Trade-off:</strong> The trade-off is liquidity
                  fragmentation: capital is split into many small pools rather
                  than one big pool. Aave&apos;s model is more capital-efficient
                  (lenders and borrowers aggregate in one place, so there&apos;s
                  deep liquidity), but it means all assets in that pool share
                  risks. Silo&apos;s model is more secure per asset but less
                  efficient.

                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Maple is a different beast – it&apos;s often described as
                  &quot;DeFi&apos;s Institutional Lender.&quot; Maple&apos;s
                  platform focuses on under-collateralised loans to
                  institutional borrowers (like trading firms, market makers,
                  etc.), which is a contrast to Aave&apos;s fully
                  collateralised, permissionless model.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  In Maple, you typically have KYC-gated pools managed by Pool
                  Delegates who assess borrowers. Lenders (often also accredited
                  or institutional) deposit into these pools to earn yield from
                  loans made to known companies. Credit risk replaces collateral
                  – borrowers might post some collateral, but loans can be
                  partially or even mostly unsecured, based on off-chain credit
                  agreements.

                <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm">
                  <strong>For lenders:</strong> Yields on Maple can be higher to
                  compensate for credit risk – double-digit APY is common (e.g.
                  Maple&apos;s Blue Chip pool was offering ~12% and a riskier
                  pool ~17% APY in 2024). These are notably higher than
                  Aave&apos;s typical ~5-10% on stablecoins at the time.
                  However, that yield comes with the risk that a borrower may
                  default.

                <strong>Summary:</strong> Aave is open to anyone and instant,
                but requires collateral; Maple is exclusive to institutions (as
                borrowers) and involves human risk assessment, but enables
                capital to earn yield from real-world lending. For an everyday
                DeFi user, Maple isn&apos;t directly accessible unless you
                qualify as a lender in their pools. Aave, on the other hand, is
                integrating features to attract institutions in a decentralised
                way while maintaining its permissionless nature for retail

              revolutionary &quot;hub-and-spoke&quot; architecture that will
              change how Aave&apos;s markets operate. Currently, in V3, each
              blockchain (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.) has an independent Aave
              deployment with its own liquidity pools. Liquidity is fragmented
              by network – e.g. the Aave Ethereum market is separate from
              Avalanche&apos;s. Aave V4 aims to unify liquidity within each
              chain and allow much more modular, specialised markets via the

                  There is a central Liquidity Hub on each chain that holds all

                  this hub to facilitate specific types of lending/borrowing
                  markets. Users interact with Spokes (e.g. a main pool or a
                  special interest pool), which draw liquidity from the shared
                  hub. This unifies liquidity (improving capital efficiency for
                  lenders and borrowers) while isolating risk within each

                expanding into new domains (perhaps lending against tokenised

                leveraged products in a contained way). It&apos;s a

                  Q: Is Aave V3 safe for beginners?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  A: Aave V3 is designed with many safety mechanisms (like
                  health factor monitoring, conservative risk parameters, and
                  audited smart contracts). For beginners, lending stablecoins
                  or blue-chip assets on Aave is generally considered a
                  lower-risk way to earn interest in DeFi. The main thing is to
                  avoid complex strategies until you&apos;re comfortable. Start
                  by depositing a small amount and seeing how it works. Always
                  keep an eye on your health factor if you borrow. While no
                  platform is 100% risk-free (smart contract exploits or
                  stablecoin issues can happen), Aave&apos;s track record so far
                  is excellent, and it has a large community and governance
                  process focusing on risk management.

                  Q: What&apos;s the difference between variable and stable
                  borrow rates on Aave?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  A: When you borrow on Aave, you often can choose a variable
                  interest rate or a stable interest rate. A variable rate
                  fluctuates with market conditions – if lots of people borrow
                  that asset, the rate goes up, and vice versa. A stable rate is
                  an attempt to offer a semi-fixed rate: it&apos;s set higher
                  than the current variable rate and won&apos;t change with
                  small market fluctuations, but it can adjust if the variable
                  rate moves a lot or if certain conditions are met (so
                  it&apos;s not a guaranteed fixed rate forever, but it&apos;s
                  more predictable in the short term). Variable rates are
                  usually lower initially and better if you plan to borrow
                  short-term or think rates will drop. Stable rates are good if
                  you want certainty and are holding a loan long-term.

                  Q: What happens if a stablecoin I lent or borrowed depegs?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  A: Aave relies on price oracles to determine the value of
                  assets. If a stablecoin (supposed to be $1) loses its peg
                  significantly, a few things can happen. If you borrowed that
                  stablecoin and its price shoots above $1, the value of your
                  debt (in USD terms) increases – that could lower your health
                  factor and potentially cause liquidation. If you lent that
                  stablecoin and it crashes below $1, the value of your
                  collateral drops, which could also threaten your position if
                  you borrowed against it. Aave&apos;s safety modules might kick
                  in for extreme cases – for instance, governance might freeze a
                  market or adjust parameters – but those are not immediate.

                  Q: How does Aave make money?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  A: Aave&apos;s revenue comes from a portion of the interest
                  paid by borrowers. When you see an interest rate on Aave,
                  borrowers pay that, and lenders receive slightly less – the
                  difference is Aave&apos;s reserve factor. For example, if
                  borrowers pay 5% APY on an asset and the reserve factor is
                  20%, lenders might get 4% and Aave&apos;s protocol reserve
                  earns 1%. These reserves are used as a backstop (insurance)
                  and can be claimed by AAVE token governance or used to burn
                  AAVE, etc., depending on governance decisions. Additionally,
                  Aave introduced a fee on flash loans (a one-time fee for
                  borrowing with no collateral within one transaction) –
                  currently 0.05% of the flash loan amount goes to the protocol.

                  Q: Can I use Aave V3 on Layer 2 solutions or only on Ethereum?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  A: Aave V3 was deployed not only on Ethereum mainnet but also
                  on several other networks, including Layer 2s and sidechains.
                  At launch, it went live on Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum,
                  Optimism, and others. By 2025, Aave V3 is on a wide array of
                  networks – from Arbitrum and Optimism (popular Ethereum L2s),
                  to Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, and even newer chains like Base
                  or zkSync Era as they gain traction. Using Aave on those
                  networks is very similar to using it on mainnet, but
                  you&apos;ll enjoy lower gas fees and sometimes different asset
                  selections.

                  Q: What is the AAVE token used for? Do I need it to use Aave?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  A: The AAVE token is the governance token of the Aave
                  protocol. If you hold AAVE, you can vote on proposals that
                  affect Aave (like adding new assets, adjusting parameters,
                  deploying new versions, etc.). AAVE also has a role in
                  Aave&apos;s safety module: AAVE stakers backstop the protocol
                  against deficits – they earn rewards but could be slashed if
                  there&apos;s a shortfall event. As a normal user, you do NOT
                  need AAVE token to lend or borrow on Aave – you can interact
                  with the protocol purely with the assets you want to
                  lend/borrow. Aave doesn&apos;t charge a platform fee token or
                  anything. Think of AAVE like the &quot;ownership/share&quot;
                  of the platform. But it&apos;s entirely optional for using the
                  platform&apos;s core functions.

                  Q: How does Aave compare to Compound?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  A: Compound is another pioneer of DeFi lending. Aave and
                  Compound are often compared because both offer pooled lending
                  and over-collateralised borrowing. The main differences as of
                  V3 are features and asset support. Aave tends to list more
                  assets (especially long-tail assets via Polygon, etc., and now
                  via Isolation Mode) whereas Compound kept a narrower set of
                  major assets. Aave introduced features like flash loans,
                  stable rate borrowing, and of course the V3 enhancements
                  (E-Mode, Isolation, cross-chain, caps) – Compound&apos;s
                  recent versions have added some similar concepts. In usage,
                  Aave&apos;s UI and flexibility is often praised, while
                  Compound is known for simplicity. Interest rate models differ
                  slightly, but to an average user they feel similar (supply
                  APR, borrow APR that adjust with utilisation). Both are solid,
                  but Aave has grown larger in TVL and tends to innovate faster
                  now. Still, Compound might offer better rates on certain
                  assets at times or be preferable if you trust its minimalist
                  approach more.

              In summary, Aave V3 has proven itself as a core DeFi protocol for
              borrowing and lending, balancing innovation (like E-Mode) with
              security (Isolation Mode, etc.). It empowered users to do more
              with their assets – from earning passive income on stablecoins to
              executing sophisticated leveraged strategies – all while managing
              risk transparently. As Aave transitions to V4, the protocol is set
              to become even more versatile and efficient, reinforcing
              Aave&apos;s position as a pillar of decentralized finance.
