      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Compound Finance stands as one of the foundational pillars of
        decentralized finance (DeFi), having pioneered the algorithmic money
        market protocol that revolutionized how users interact with lending and
        borrowing in the crypto ecosystem. Since its launch in 2018, Compound
        has been at the forefront of DeFi innovation, introducing concepts like
        algorithmic interest rates and governance tokens that have become
        industry standards.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        As one of the earliest and most successful DeFi protocols, Compound has
        played a crucial role in establishing the infrastructure that powers the
        entire DeFi ecosystem. The protocol's innovative approach to money
        markets has inspired countless other projects and continues to serve as
        a model for decentralized lending platforms worldwide.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
        What is Compound Finance?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Compound Finance is a decentralized money market protocol that enables
        users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies through an algorithmic system.
        Built on Ethereum, Compound allows users to earn interest on their
        crypto assets by supplying them to liquidity pools, while borrowers can
        access liquidity by providing collateral and borrowing against it.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The protocol operates through a system of cTokens (Compound Tokens),
        which represent a user's share in a specific lending pool. When you
        supply assets to Compound, you receive cTokens that automatically accrue
        interest over time, representing your proportional share of the pool
        plus accumulated interest.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
        How Compound Finance Works
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Compound's core mechanism revolves around algorithmic interest rate
        determination and automated market making:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Algorithmic Interest Rates
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Compound uses an algorithmic model to determine interest rates based on
        supply and demand. When more users want to borrow a particular asset,
        the interest rate increases to incentivize more suppliers. Conversely,
        when there's excess supply, rates decrease to encourage more borrowing.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        cToken System
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        When you supply assets to Compound, you receive cTokens (like cUSDC,
        cETH, cDAI) that represent your share of the lending pool. These tokens
        automatically accrue interest and can be redeemed for the underlying
        asset plus accumulated interest at any time.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Collateralized Borrowing
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Users can borrow assets by providing collateral. The protocol uses a
        collateralization ratio system where users can only borrow up to a
        certain percentage of their collateral's value, ensuring the protocol
        remains solvent.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
        Key Features of Compound Finance
      </h2>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Algorithmic Interest Rate Model
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Compound's interest rate model automatically adjusts rates based on
        utilization, creating efficient markets for lending and borrowing
        without requiring manual intervention.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Instant Liquidity
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Users can withdraw their supplied assets at any time without waiting
        periods, providing instant liquidity for their crypto holdings.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Governance System
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Compound operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) where
        COMP token holders can vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Multi-Asset Support
      </h3>

        COMP Token Economics
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The COMP token serves as Compound's governance token and has several key
        functions:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Governance:</strong> COMP holders can vote on protocol
          upgrades and parameter changes
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Liquidity Mining:</strong> COMP rewards are distributed to
          both lenders and borrowers
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Protocol Security:</strong> COMP can be staked to provide
          additional security to the protocol
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fee Distribution:</strong> A portion of protocol fees may be
          distributed to COMP stakers
        </li>
      </ul>
