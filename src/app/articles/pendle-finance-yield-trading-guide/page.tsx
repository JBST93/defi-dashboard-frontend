      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Pendle Finance has emerged as one of the most innovative protocols in
        the DeFi space, introducing a revolutionary approach to yield trading
        and management. By tokenizing future yield streams, Pendle allows users
        to trade, hedge, and optimize their yield strategies in ways that were
        previously impossible in traditional finance.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Since its launch in 2021, Pendle has grown to manage over $1 billion in
        total value locked (TVL), becoming the go-to platform for sophisticated
        yield strategies. The protocol's unique mechanism of separating
        principal and yield has opened up new possibilities for DeFi users, from
        fixed-yield seekers to yield farmers looking to hedge their positions.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
        What is Pendle Finance?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Pendle Finance is a decentralized protocol that enables users to
        tokenize and trade future yield streams from various DeFi protocols. By
        separating the principal and yield components of yield-bearing assets,
        Pendle creates two distinct tokens: Principal Tokens (PT) and Yield
        Tokens (YT), each representing different aspects of the underlying
        asset.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        This innovative approach allows users to trade yield separately from
        principal, enabling strategies like fixed-yield investing, yield
        hedging, and leveraged yield farming that weren't possible before
        Pendle's introduction.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
        How Pendle Finance Works
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Pendle's core mechanism revolves around the tokenization of
        yield-bearing assets. Here's how it works:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Principal Tokens (PT) and Yield Tokens (YT)
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        When you deposit a yield-bearing asset like stETH or aUSDC into Pendle,
        it gets split into two components:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Principal Token (PT):</strong> Represents the underlying
          asset's principal value, redeemable at maturity
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Yield Token (YT):</strong> Represents the right to receive all
          yield generated by the underlying asset until maturity
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Fixed Yield Trading
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Users can trade PT tokens at a discount to their face value, effectively
        locking in a fixed yield rate. For example, if you buy PT-stETH at 0.95
        ETH for 1 ETH worth of stETH, you're locking in a 5% fixed yield until
        maturity.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Variable Yield Trading
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        YT tokens can be traded separately, allowing users to speculate on
        future yield rates or hedge against yield volatility. This creates a
        market for yield expectations and risk management.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
        Key Features of Pendle Finance
      </h2>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Automated Market Maker (AMM)
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Pendle uses a custom AMM designed specifically for yield tokens,
        ensuring efficient price discovery and liquidity for both PT and YT
        tokens. The AMM accounts for time decay and yield accrual in its pricing
        model.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Multiple Asset Support
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Pendle supports a wide range of yield-bearing assets including stETH,
        aUSDC, aUSDT, cUSDC, and many others across different DeFi protocols.
        This diversity allows for various yield strategies and hedging
        opportunities.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Flexible Maturity Periods
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Users can choose from various maturity periods, typically ranging from 1
        month to 2 years, allowing for different investment horizons and risk
        profiles.
      </p>

        Yield Trading Strategies
      </h2>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Fixed Yield Strategy
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Buy PT tokens at a discount to lock in fixed yields. This strategy is
        ideal for users who want predictable returns and are willing to forgo
        potential upside in exchange for certainty.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Yield Speculation
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Trade YT tokens to speculate on future yield movements. This strategy
        allows experienced users to profit from yield volatility and market
        inefficiencies.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Yield Hedging
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Use YT tokens to hedge against yield volatility in other positions. This
        is particularly useful for yield farmers who want to protect against
        declining yields.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Leveraged Yield Farming
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Combine PT and YT tokens to create leveraged positions. This advanced
        strategy can amplify returns but also increases risk.
      </p>
