      <p className="text-gray-700">
        MakerDAO stands as one of the most foundational and innovative protocols
        in the DeFi ecosystem, having created the first successful decentralized
        stablecoin, DAI. Since its launch in 2017, MakerDAO has revolutionized
        the concept of stablecoins by creating a system that maintains price
        stability through over-collateralization and decentralized governance,
        rather than relying on centralized reserves.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        The protocol has grown to become one of the most important
        infrastructure pieces in DeFi, with DAI serving as a cornerstone for
        countless DeFi applications and strategies. MakerDAO's innovative
        approach to stablecoin creation has inspired numerous other projects and
        continues to serve as a model for decentralized financial systems.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
        What is MakerDAO?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        MakerDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that operates
        the Maker Protocol, which enables the creation of DAI, a decentralized
        stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. The protocol uses a system of
        Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs) where users can lock up collateral
        assets to generate DAI, creating a decentralized and trustless
        stablecoin system.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The protocol is governed by MKR token holders who vote on important
        decisions such as collateral types, stability fees, and other
        parameters. This decentralized governance model ensures that DAI remains
        stable and trustworthy without relying on centralized entities.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
        How MakerDAO Works
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        MakerDAO's core mechanism revolves around the creation and management of
        DAI through collateralized debt positions:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs)
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Users can lock up approved collateral assets (like ETH, WBTC, or other
        cryptocurrencies) in a CDP to generate DAI. The amount of DAI that can
        be generated depends on the collateral's value and the collateralization
        ratio.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Over-Collateralization
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        DAI is always over-collateralized, meaning users must lock up more value
        in collateral than the DAI they generate. This ensures that DAI remains
        fully backed and stable even during market volatility.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Stability Mechanism
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The protocol uses a system of stability fees (interest rates) and
        liquidation mechanisms to maintain DAI's peg to the US dollar. When DAI
        trades above $1, stability fees decrease to encourage more DAI creation,
        and vice versa.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
        Key Features of MakerDAO
      </h2>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Decentralized Governance
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        MKR token holders vote on all important protocol decisions, ensuring
        that DAI remains decentralized and community-controlled.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Multiple Collateral Types
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The protocol supports various collateral types including ETH, WBTC,
        USDC, and other approved assets, providing flexibility for DAI creation.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Stability Fees
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Dynamic stability fees help maintain DAI's peg by adjusting the cost of
        creating new DAI based on market conditions.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Liquidation System
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Automated liquidation mechanisms protect the protocol by liquidating
        under-collateralized positions, ensuring DAI remains fully backed.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
        MKR Token Economics
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The MKR token serves multiple critical functions within the MakerDAO
        ecosystem:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Governance:</strong> MKR holders vote on protocol upgrades and
          parameter changes
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stability Fees:</strong> MKR is used to pay stability fees,
          with excess MKR being burned
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Liquidation Penalties:</strong> MKR is used to pay liquidation
          penalties, with excess MKR being burned
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Protocol Security:</strong> MKR can be staked to provide
          additional security to the protocol
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
        Supported Collateral Types
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        MakerDAO supports a wide range of collateral types:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Ethereum (ETH):</strong> Primary collateral with high
          liquidity
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):</strong> Bitcoin exposure with DeFi
          utility
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stablecoins (USDC, USDP):</strong> Low-volatility collateral
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Liquid Staking Derivatives:</strong> stETH, rETH, and other
          staking derivatives
        </li>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
        DAI Creation and Management
      </h2>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Creating DAI
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        To create DAI, users lock up approved collateral in a CDP and generate
        DAI up to the maximum allowed by the collateralization ratio. The
        process is trustless and can be done directly from a wallet.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Managing Positions
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Users can add more collateral, generate more DAI, or repay DAI to free
        up collateral. All operations are transparent and verifiable on-chain.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Stability Fee Management
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Users must pay stability fees on their DAI debt, which can be paid in
        DAI or MKR. The fees are dynamic and adjust based on market conditions.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
        DAI Use Cases and Strategies

        used for lending, borrowing, trading, and yield farming.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
        Leverage Strategies
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Users can create DAI against their crypto holdings to access liquidity
        without selling, enabling leveraged trading and investment strategies.
